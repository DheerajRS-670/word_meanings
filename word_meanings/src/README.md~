This program finds out the combined single digit number representing
 a given word. Each word has a meaning, and this program helps identify the
 meaning of a word. The meaning of the word can be identified by reducing the word
 to a single digit number (may be multiple digits later) which has a specific
 meaning

Below are the meanings of single digit numbers that I have identified based on classification
 of words:

1: soul
2: separate
3: how nature works
4: incomplete
5: nature, satisfaction, mind
6: challenge, intensify, realize
7: unending, learn, detect, innovate, inspire
8: complete
9: dark, immature, death
